# Graphics Jeopardy!

Pick a category and a level, 
then go into graphics.cpp and search for the comments labeled with 
the first letter of the category and the level (e.g. D1 for Drawing level 1). 
Uncomment that section of code and guess what will happen before you run the program. 
The goal is to guess as many right as you can!

Note that you may need to look at other parts of the code, 
especially for levels 2 and 3, 
before you can understand what the commented line(s) will do.

| Drawing | Keyboard | Mouse | Timer |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1       | 1        | 1     | 1     |
| 2       | 2        | 2     | 2     |
| 3       | 3        | 3     | 3     |
