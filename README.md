Welcome to Rectangle Goalie!

Summary: This program utilizes the rect and circle classes used in the guided projects to create
an interactive goalie game with multiple levels. There are 4 different screens throughout the game:
1. Welcome Screen: welcomes user prompts them to enter 'p' to start
2. Game play Screen: user controls rectangle with up and down arrow keys to block shots
3. In Between Level Screen: tells user what level they are on, prompts them to hit spacebar to move on
4. You lost Screen: if they let a ball in, they lose. They can start over by hitting 'p'

NOTE: you can hit 'p' at any point during game to start over


User Guide: The goal of the game is to block the shots by using the keyboard up and down keys.
Each round your rectangle will get smaller, the balls will come faster, and there will be more balls!
If you let a ball past you, you lose.

Helpful hints: 
- while waiting for next ball, reposition yourself to center of screen.
- the first ball each round comes at you quick, be ready!
